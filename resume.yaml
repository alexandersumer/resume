summary: >-
  AI platform engineer at Atlassian.
  Reliability and performance of chat and agent AI systems supporting
  all Atlassian's AI products and integrations.

experience:
  - company: Atlassian
    location: Sydney, Australia
    role: Senior Software Engineer, AI Platform
    dates: Nov 2019 – Present
    bullets:
      - >-
        Promoted to Senior within two years, now operating at Principal level.
        Highest change throughput, review volume, and lowest incident rate in
        the org while leading 9 engineers across three projects.
      - heading: "Autonomous Browser Agent:"
        text: >-
          Led 5 engineers (including 2 seniors) building a system where a
          vision-language model (Gemini) interprets browser screenshots and
          returns coordinate-based commands via Playwright/CDP. Designed warm
          pod pools for sub-second session start, HMAC-signed routing, and
          per-session container isolation. Topped internal evals; completed
          complex compliance workflows end-to-end.
      - heading: "Agent Sandbox:"
        text: >-
          Built a new execution platform supporting session hibernation with
          disk-backed state, 20 GB persistent volumes, and hardware-level
          isolation via KATA Containers (lightweight VMs). Replaced a legacy
          service that had no file system and scaled poorly (linear namespace
          scan). Agents can now generate files, produce charts, and resume
          across sessions.
      - heading: "Unified AI Platform Architecture:"
        text: >-
          Leading 5 engineers (including 1 principal) to raise reliability
          horizontally across all AI products, reducing average incident time
          to recovery from 10 hours to 1. Moved the platform from a synchronous monolith to a
          reactive, non-blocking architecture using Kotlin Coroutines. Unified
          HTTP clients across all integrations with standardised request
          caching. Added a two-tier cache that cut redundant network calls by
          90%.
      - >-
        Built a rollout service for Atlassian's third-largest monorepo, automating
        safe progressive deployments and improving release reliability for hundreds
        of engineers.
      - heading: "Jira Issue Service:"
        text: >-
          Built from inception a 99.999%-reliability, low-latency platform
          service powering multiple Atlassian products. Proposed and gained
          Principal-level buy-in for a persistence layer on the Mercury Cache
          library. Led the real-time Issue Event Stream with at-least-once
          delivery. Parallelized authorization checks for a 20× P90 latency
          improvement. Redesigned queries and caching to cut P99 latency from
          10s to 200ms for the largest customers.

      (Lambda, SNS), and introduced unit testing standards across the team.

  - company: WiseTech Global
    dates: Aug 2017 – Sep 2018
    earlier: true
    role: Associate Developer
    note: >-
      Built a coordinate-based distance/time matrix API
      with algorithm selection based on graph structure. Replaced SQL literals
      with table-valued parameters for a 4× query performance improvement.
